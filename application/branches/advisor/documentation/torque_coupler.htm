Torque coupler</h3>

<p><b><u>Role of subsystem in vehicle</u></b>
<br>Physically, a torque coupler is a three-sprocket belt or chain drive
whereby two torque sources combine their torques to provide to a drivetrain
component such as the gearbox or final drive. The torque coupler block
diagram processes a torque and speed request from the downstream drivetrain
component and apportions requests of the two ‘feeder’ torque sources.
<p><b><u>Description of modeling approach</u></b>
<br>The effects of torque loss and a gear ratio between the second of the
torque input devices and the output are modeled here. The torque loss is
a constant whenever the torque coupler is spinning.
<p>The torque coupler first requests the sum of necessary output torque
and torque coupler loss from the first torque source. Using the actual/available
torque of the first source, it requests the balance of the second torque
source. The speeds of the two torque providers are in constant proportion
to the torque coupler output speed: the first input speed equals the output
speed, and the second input speed is greater by a factor tc_mc_to_fc_ratio.
