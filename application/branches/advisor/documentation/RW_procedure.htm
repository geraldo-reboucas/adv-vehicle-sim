<p><b><font size=+1>Test Procedure Description</font></b>
<br>The Real World Test Procedure is intended to capture real-world driving
patterns by running simulations and soaks over a period of several days.&nbsp;
It is based on data available from CARB on real-world driving patterns.&nbsp;
The setup screen shown below shows the various input options.&nbsp; The
user can choose from a 2-day set of cycles, or a more comprehensive 16-day
set of cycles.&nbsp; The user also specifies the ambient temperature during
the entire test.
<p>As a benchmark, the user can compare the Real-World results to FTP results.&nbsp;
The user may specify the length of the cold soak between the preparation
cycle (UDDS) and the FTP.&nbsp; The official test procedure specifies a
soak period of 12-36 hours after the prep cycle.&nbsp; If this option is
not checked, the FTP will run with no preparation cycle or soak, but with
cold start initial conditions.
<p>In addition to tracking the fuel economy, emissions, and miles during
the set of cycles, the user has the option to track time variables.&nbsp;
These are added by the user to the 'Variables to track' section in the
setup screen.

<p>The initial conditions of the vehicle are set to hot, indicating that
the vehicle had just stopped driving.&nbsp; The first soak is a 36 hour
soak.&nbsp; The average velocity of the trips ranges from 5 mph to 75 mph.&nbsp;
The 2-day option runs a set of 13 soak/driving trips.&nbsp; The total cycle
is shown below:

<p>&nbsp;The 16-day option simulated 107 soak/driving trips.

<br>The Real-World results screen is shown below:

<p><b>Real World Final Results</b>
<br>The final Real-World results presented are the raw distance, gas equivalent
fuel economy/consumption, and emissions.&nbsp; If checked to run, the button
for the FTP results pulls up the normal ADVISOR results screen for the
FTP time history plots.
<p><b>Output Plots</b>
<br>There are 8 generic output plots available:
<ol>
<li>
cum_soak_dur: Cumulative soak duration, given in hours.&nbsp; A comparison
plot is made to the data from CARB.</li>

<li>
cum_trip_mi/km: Cumulative trip mileage; in the plot above, 80% of the
trips were approximately 9 miles or less.&nbsp; Again, a comparison plot
is made to the data from CARB.</li>

<li>
cum_trip_mph/kph: Cumulative trip speed with a comparison to the CARB study.</li>

<li>
cum_starts_perday: Cumulative starts per day; comparison to CARB.</li>

<li>
trip_tot_emis_*: Cumulative values for the four emissions given per trip.</li>
</ol>
<b>Continuous Time Plots</b>
<br>The continuous time plots available are those variables selected by
the user in the input screen.&nbsp; The variable name has a 'C' added to
the beginning of the name to indicate that it is continuous through the
entire 2 or 16-day set of cycles.&nbsp; Note for hybrid vehicles:&nbsp;
it is useful to track SOC to observe the final value and compare to the
initial value for the lengthy execution time of the test procedure means
that 'zero-delta' SOC correction is not employed.
