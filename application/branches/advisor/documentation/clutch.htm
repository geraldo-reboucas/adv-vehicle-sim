Clutch</h3>

<p><b><u>Role of subsystem in vehicle</u></b>
<br>The ‘clutch’ block generally transmits torque and speed requests from
the ‘gearbox’ or, in the case of the pre-transmission parallel hybrid,
the torque coupler, to the ‘ICE fuel converter.’ It also generally transmits
actual torque and speed from the ‘ICE fuel converter’ back to the ‘gearbox’
or ‘torque coupler.’ This block is useful wherever the vehicle control
needs to interrupt torque transmission from one component to another.
<p><b><u>Description of modeling approach</u></b>
<br>The clutch has three states: disengaged, slipping, and fully engaged.
<p>When disengaged, the clutch requests and transmits no torque. It requests
the input speed be the same as the requested output speed (‘request’ data
path), and passes the requested output speed as the output speed limit
(‘actual’ data path).
<p>When slipping, it requests that the output torque be the same as the
input torque, and passes the actual input torque as the actual output torque.
It requests that the input speed be the predefined, constant slip speed,
and passes the requested output speed as the speed limit.
<p>When engaged, it passes torque and speed unchanged on both the ‘request’
and ‘actual’ data paths.
