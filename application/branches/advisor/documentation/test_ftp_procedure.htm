<p><b><font size=+1>Test Procedure Description</font></b>
<br>The FTP and FTP_Hybrid test procedures in ADVISOR are provided to allow
the user to simulate the Federal Test Procedure (FTP-75) drive cycle used
by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to certify the fuel economy
and emissions performance of consumer vehicles. This test sets the initial
conditions to represent a cold start and then simulates an FTP-75 cycle.&nbsp;
An FTP-75 cycle is composed of one UDDS cycle followed by a 10 minute soak
in which the key is turned off.&nbsp; This soak is then followed by the
first 505s of an second UDDS cycle.&nbsp; For the FTP_Hybrid test procedure,
the 10 minute soak is followed by a complete second UDDS cycle.&nbsp; The
fuel economy and results of the drive cycle are then partitioned into "bags".&nbsp;
The bag results are then weighted to provide the bag-weighted results.&nbsp;
The results window displays both the individual bag results and the bag-weighted
results.&nbsp; The bag-weighting equation is provided in the notes in the
results figure.

<p>The FTP_hybrid test was introduced in ADVISOR v3.2 to account for the
variability in operating charactericts associated with hybrids.&nbsp; When
the FTP-75 test was first created, based on the performance of conventional
vehicles, both the 4th bag and the 2nd bag were assumed to provide similar
results.&nbsp; This assumption is valid for conventional and most parallel
hybrid vehicles. However, for series hybrids and hybrids that use a significant
portion of the energy storage system capacity, the assumption may not be
valid.&nbsp; Due to SOC balancing requirements the vehicle operation can
be significantly different when comparing a 3 bag test vs. a 4 bag test.
