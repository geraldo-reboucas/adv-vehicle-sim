<p><b><u>Role of subsystem in vehicle</u></b>
<br>The 'braking strategy' block determines how much braking force is required
of the front brakes and the rear brakes.&nbsp; The balance of the required
tractive force will be made up by the drivetrain to the best of its ability.&nbsp;
(If the driveline is limited in its braking ability, the front and rear
brakes will make up this final deficit according to their ability.&nbsp;
See the documentation of the <a href="brake_cont_ach.htm">achievable brake
controller</a> for more info.)
<p><b><u>Description of modeling approach</u></b>
<br>The required braking force is a function of vehicle speed and total
braking force required.&nbsp; A 1-D lookup table is used to determine the
fraction of braking force provided by the front and rear brakes.
<p><b><u>Equations used in subsystem</u></b>
<ol>
<li>
(friction braking force required of front brakes) = (total braking force
required) * (fraction of total braking force provided by front friction
brakes)</li>

<li>
(friction braking force required of rear brakes) = (total braking force
required) * [1-(fraction of total braking force required of front friction
brakes) - (fraction of total braking force required of driveline)]</li>

<li>
(fraction of total braking force required of front friction brakes) = f(vehicle
speed)</li>

<li>
(fraction of total braking force required of driveline) = f(vehicle speed)</li>
</ol>
All braking forces are negative by convention.
