Overview</H3>
The technical target based components in the ADVISOR database provide the
user with the ability to create and use components in simulations that
are based on specifications related to that component. In general a baseline
data file is selected and the parameters defining that component are scaled
and adjusted to match the user-defined specifications. The new parameters
are not saved to the baseline file but are available in the Matlab workspace
for subsequent simulations.
<H3>
Fuel converter</H3>
The user can define the following specifications.

</TABLE>
&nbsp;
<BR>The peak efficiency value will be used to scale the fuel usage map
to produce the desired peak efficiency while the specific power value will
be used to define the mass of the fuel converter based on its current maximum
power value.
<H3>
Motor/controller</H3>
The user can define the following specifications.
<BR>&nbsp;
<TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=4 CELLPADDING=4 >

<TR>
<TD>Specific power</TD>

<TD>(W/kg)</TD>

<TD>750</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
&nbsp;
<BR>All points in the 2-20% power range of the motor efficiency map will
be assigned this efficiency value. This power range has been chosen because
it is the typical operating range of a properly sized (for PNGV grade and
acceleration performance specifications) motor/controller in a vehicle
operating over the UDDS and the Federal Highway Drive Schedule. The specific
power value will be used to define the mass of the motor controller based
on its current maximum power value.
<H3>
Energy storage system</H3>

</TABLE>
&nbsp;
<BR>The ess_voc vector will be scaled such that the mean voltage is equal
to the user defined nominal voltage. The C/10 energy capacity and the 12C
energy capacity parameter values are then used to generate the coefficient
and the exponent for the peukert equation used in ADVISOR. The routine
then determines the appropriate discharge resistance values that will satisfy
the rest of the specifications. The power in the power to energy ratio
is calculated as Power = V*I where V and I are the terminal voltage and
current respectively of the battery module at the end of the specified
discharge duration time period. The constant power value required to discharge
the module from high SOC to low SOC (or the minimum operating voltage whichever
occurs first) within the specified discharge duration is requested of the
battery to find V and I. The energy in the power to energy ratio is the
total energy out of the battery module during a C/1 constant power discharge
from high SOC to low SOC (or the minimum operating voltage whichever occurs
first). Finally, the mass of the module is determined based on the C/1
energy capacity calculated above and the specified specific energy.

</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Frontal area</TD>

<TD>(m^2)</TD>

<TD>car ~ 2.5</TD>

</TABLE>
All of the specifications for the vehicle are assigned in the workspace
by overriding the current values. No scaling takes place.
