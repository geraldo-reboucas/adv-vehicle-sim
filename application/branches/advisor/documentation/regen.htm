   <title>Regenerative Braking</title>

<body>
<b>Regenerative Braking</b>
<p>Regenerative braking is the process by which some of the kinetic energy
stored in the vehicle's translating mass is stored in the vehicle during
decelerations.&nbsp; In most electric and hybrid electric vehicles on the
road today, this is accomplished by operating the traction motor as a generator,
providing braking torque to the wheels and recharging the traction batteries.&nbsp;
The energy provided by regenerative braking can then be used for propulsion
or to power vehicle accessories.
<p><i>Overview</i>
<br>Of the total braking torque required, X% will be performed by the driveline
(motor, engine, trans, etc.) and 100-X% is performed by
<br>the friction brakes.&nbsp; X is defined as a function of vehicle speed
by the inputs wh_fa_dl_brake_frac and wh_fa_dl_brake_mph.&nbsp; By default,
driveline braking is used less at low vehicle speeds than at high speeds.&nbsp;
Then, of the X% performed by the driveline, the available regenerative
braking energy minus any efficiency losses of components through which
the energy must flow (ie., gearbox, motor/controller, energy storage system)
is captured by the energy storage system.

<p><i>Example</i>
<br>This example shows how ADVISOR's brake controller block cooperates
with the drivetrain component models to model a regenerative braking event.
<p>In this example, an electric vehicle decelerates from 17.3 m/s (38.8
mph) to 0 in 10 s.&nbsp; The figure below shows the vehicle speed and tractive
force required.
<p><img SRC="reg3.gif" height=466 width=568>
<p>To achieve the required deceleration, the required tractive force is
negative.&nbsp; (Note that if the required deceleration were at the same
rate as an unpowered coastdown, the required tractive force would be zero
because aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance would be enough to cause
the required deceleration.)&nbsp; This indicates an opportunity for regenerative
braking.
<p>The data in the figure above are passed from the <a href="vehicle.htm">vehicle
&lt;veh></a> block to the <a href="wheel_axle.htm">wheel and axle &lt;wh></a>
block which in turn exchanges data with the <a href="brake_cont_req.htm">braking
control</a> block.&nbsp; This block uses required speed and required force
to determine how much braking will be done by the front-axle friction brakes,
the rear-axle friction brakes, and the driveline.&nbsp; The braking done
by the driveline is the regenerative braking.&nbsp; However, it is important
to recognize that not all of the driveline braking energy can be stored--on
its way from the wheel and axle, through the drivetrain and electric motor,
and into the energy storage system (usually electrochemical batteries),
this braking energy incurs losses.
<p><img SRC="reg4.gif" height=466 width=568>
<p>The figure above shows that the regenerative braking power required
into the wheel/axle assembly is whittled away by component losses as it
moves up the driveline.&nbsp; At 2 s, the braking power required at the
tire patch (computed as veh_spd_r*veh_force_r) is 30 kW, while the braking
power required where the wheel/axle interfaces with the final drive (computed
as wh_trq_r*wh_spd_r) is 20 kW.&nbsp; 10 kW is consumed by axle losses
and by the friction brakes.&nbsp; (The variables wh_fa_fric_brake_frac,
wh_fa_fric_brake_mph, wh_fa_dl_brake_frac, and wh_fa_dl_brake_mph control
how much friction and driveline/regen braking is commanded as a function
of speed.&nbsp; Follow this <a href="advisor_appendices.htm#Input Wheel/Axle">link</a>
for more info on these variables.)&nbsp; About 3 kW is lost in the transmission
and motor, accounting for the difference between the red and black curves
at 2 s.&nbsp; Another 5 kW or so is lost in the energy storage system,
leaving about 12.5 kW (x 1 s = 12.5 kJ) making it into storage.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><u>Measuring the effect of regenerative braking</u>
<p>Let's assume we wish to see how much a particular regenerative braking
scheme improves EV range.
<p>First, we define our vehicle, with the regenerative braking scheme active.&nbsp;
(The relevant data is the WH_*.m input data file.)
<p><img SRC="reg5.gif" height=656 width=853>
<p>Then, we run the vehicle on CYC_UDDS, using default Simulation Setup
parameters except for '# of cycles,' which we set at 5.&nbsp; This results
in a distance of 30.3 miles, as seen below.
<p><img SRC="reg2.gif" height=622 width=776>
<p>We now hit the 'Back Two' button to again see the Vehicle Definition
screen.&nbsp; At the MATLAB command window, we enter 'wh_fa_dl_brake_frac,'
and MATLAB responds:
<p>wh_fa_dl_brake_frac =
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.5000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.8000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.8000
<p>To remove all regenerative braking, we enter
<p>wh_fa_dl_brake_frac=[0 0 0 0 0];
<p>We rerun the analysis using 5 x CYC_UDDS, and find the new range to
be 26.8 miles.
