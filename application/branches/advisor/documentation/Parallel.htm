<h3>
<b><font size=+1>Parallel Electric Assist Control Strategy</font></b></h3>
<b><u>Role of subsystem in vehicle</u></b>
<br>The parallel electric assist control strategy uses the motor for additional
power when needed by the vehicle and maintains charge in the batteries.
<p><b><u>Description of modeling approach</u></b>
<br><font color="#000000">The parallel assist strategy can use the electric
motor in a variety of ways:</font>
<ol>
<li>
<font color="#000000">The motor can be used for all driving torque below
a certain minimum vehicle speed.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">The motor is used for torque assist if the required
torque is greater than the maximum producable by the engine at the engine's
operating speed.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">The motor charges the batteries by regenerative braking.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">When the engine would run inefficiently at the required
engine torque at a given speed, the engine will shut off and the motor
will produce the required torque.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">When the battery SOC is low, the engine will provide
excess torque which will be used by the motor to charge the battery.</font></li>
</ol>
<b><u>Variables used in subsystem</u></b>
<br>There are six variables that determine the limits of the control strategy.&nbsp;
Their influence on the engine operation are shown in the schematics below,
and they are described in the following table.

The "Off torque envelope" and the "Minimum torque envelope" are specified
<font color="#000000">separately.&nbsp;
Since transfering energy into and out of the battery incurs losses, it
may be preferable to set the charging torque at a higher level than the
engine off torque.&nbsp; This could allow the overall efficiency of charging
and discharging the battery to be higher than it would be at a lower torque,
where the engine efficiency would be lower.</font>
<p><b><u>Implementation</u></b>
<p><i>Parallel block diagram</i>
<br>The implementation of the parallel control stategy is found in two
main blocks: the electric assist control strategy block and the vehicle
controls block.

<p><i>Electric assist control strategy block diagram</i>
<br><font color="#000000">The torque and speed load due to driving conditions
is presented to the engine through the clutch.&nbsp; The energy management
strategy determines how the torques from the engine and motor will combine
to produce the required torque while maintaining charge in the battery.</font>
<center><img SRC="cs.gif" ALT="Electric Assist Block Diagram" height=396 width=616></center>

<ol>
<li>
<font color="#000000">When the battery SOC is below cs_soc_lo, additional
torque is required from the engine to charge the battery.&nbsp; This additional
charging torque is proportional to the difference between SOC and the average
of cs_lo_soc and cs_hi_soc.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">This engine torque is prevented from being below
a certain fraction, cs_min_trq_frac, of the maximum engine torque at the
current operating speed.&nbsp; This is intended to prevent the engine from
operating at an inefficiently low torque.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">Engine torque is only requested when the engine is
on.</font></li>
</ol>
<i>Vehicle controls/Engine On block diagram</i>
<br>The state of the engine (on or off) is determined by the following
block diagram.
<center><img SRC="engine,on.gif" ALT="Engine On Block Diagram" height=722 width=848></center>

<ol>
<li>
If the speed required is less than the electric launch speed, cs_electric_launch_spd,
the engine could turn off.</li>

<li>
If the SOC is higher than its low limit, the engine could turn off.&nbsp;
If both the requested speed is less than the launch speed and the SOC is
higher than the low limit, the engine will turn off.</li>

<li>
If the torque required is less than a cutoff torque, cs_off_trq_frac fraction
of the maximum torque, the engine could turn off.&nbsp; If both the requested
torque is lower than this cutoff and the SOC is higher than the low limit,
the engine will turn off.</li>
