Continuously Variable Transmission</h3>

<p><b><u>Role of subsystem in vehicle</u></b>
<br>The ‘cvt’ accepts torque from the clutch or other upstream device,
and transmits it to the final drive after overcoming its own losses and
increasing the torque by the current pulley ratio.
<p><b><u>Description of modeling approach</u></b>
<br>The CVT block interacts with the CVT controller, which determines the
current pulley ratio. The CVT then uses this pulley ratio to estimate input
torque and speed, and in turn uses these along with a lookup table to compute
CVT efficiency. The efficiency is used to compute torque losses as measured
on the input side, and the torque required to overcome the CVT’s inertia
is also taken from the input side. The above order of calculation applies
to the ‘request’ data branch. For the ‘available/actual’ data branch, the
pulley ratio and efficiency computed in the ‘request’ branch are used to
perform the necessary torque multiplication and speed reduction.
