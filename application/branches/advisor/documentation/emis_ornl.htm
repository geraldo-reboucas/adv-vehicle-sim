Emissions Control Models</h1></center>

<center>Contributed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory</center>

<p>Emissions control has steadily risen in level of importance both from
a regulatory standpoint and from a consumer perspective.&nbsp; As the result
of a collaborative effort between NREL and ORNL, two new emissions control
models have been developed.&nbsp; The two models are for a diesel oxydation
catalyst with and without an integrated diesel particulate filter.&nbsp;
Previous emissions models determined the tailpipe out emissions based on
constituent conversion efficiencies.&nbsp; The conversion efficiency for
each constituent was defined as a function of catalyst temperature.&nbsp;
The catalyst temperature was determined based on the physical properties
of the exhaust system, the exhaust flow rate, and the exhaust temperature.&nbsp;
The new models add several new dimensions to the conversion efficiency
calculation.&nbsp; The efficiencies are now a function of catalyst temperature,
exhaust temperature, space velocity (i.e. combination of catalyst geometry
and exhaust flow rate), oxygen concentration, and critieria emissions concetrations.&nbsp;
Based on test data collected at ORNL, regression coefficients have been
derived to the data with respect to these input parameters to provide the
conversion efficiency values.&nbsp; Currently, the diesel oxydation catalyst
model is only available for use with the FC_CI67_emis and the FC_CI60_emis
engine data files.&nbsp; In future versions of ADVISOR we expect to include
emission models for an NOx adsorber.
<p>Figure 1 below shows how the model has been integrated into ADVISOR
using a boolean switch, if ex_ornl_bool is set to 1 the emission control
models developed at ORNL will be used.&nbsp; If set to 0 the standard ADVISOR
relationships will be active.&nbsp; Figure 2 summarizes the inputs and
outputs included in the calculation of the specific constituent removal
efficiencies.&nbsp; Within each of the *Conversion blocks there is a functional
relatioship defined correlating the removal efficiency to the set of input
parameters.&nbsp; The format of the functional relationship and the coefficients
of the relationship have been derived based on experimental data.&nbsp;
It is recommended that you do not modify the relationships or the coefficients
at this time.

<p>We expect that there will be significant development in this section
of the model in future versions of ADVISOR so please do forward any comments
or recommendations you might have to advisor@nrel.gov.
