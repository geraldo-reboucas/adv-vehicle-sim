<h1>Neural Network Emissions Models</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As a contrast to lookup tables&nbsp; (where emissions are looked up by
interpolation off of a torque by speed table), <a href="http://www.emsl.pnl.gov:2080/proj/neuron/neural/neural.homepage.html"> neural networks</a> are equation based solutions
that can be &quot;trained&quot; to
predict outputs. West Virginia University has created two such neural network
models for use in ADVISOR. The first corresponds to a 1999 Cummins ISM 370 and
the other to a 1994 Navistar T 444E--both engines fueled on diesel no. 2.</p>

<p>The Cummins engine model is trained on four cycles: the heavy-duty federal
test procedure (FTP), the European Stationary Cycle (ESC), the European
Transient Cycle (ETC), and a randomly generated cycle. The Navistar engine model
is trained on the FTP only.</p>

<p>The neural network models use engine torque and shaft speed and their time
derivatives as inputs. Thus, one advantage that the neural network model has
over the 2D lookup table model is the incorporation of transient effects.</p>

<h2>Implementation </h2>

<p>Six neural network models have been provided by West Virginia University: CO
prediction for the Cummins ISM, CO<sub>2</sub> prediction for the Cummins ISM,
NO<sub>x</sub> prediction for the Cummins ISM, CO prediction for the Navistar T444E,
CO<sub>2</sub> prediction for the Navistar T444E, and NO<sub>x</sub>
 prediction for the Navistar T444E. Each neural network model takes six input parameters
to predict emissions at a given time-step. The inputs and outputs are listed
below: </p>

<p>The user has access to the neural network models in three formats:&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
  <li>By calling the neural network mex files directly (cumminsCO, navistarNOx,
    etc.--type 'help cumminsCO' on the command line for usage)</li>
  <li>As post processing after an ADVISOR run using nnProc.m-- a function in
    &lt;ADVISOR main directory&gt;/data/fuel_converter/neural_net (type 'help
    nnProc' on the command line for usage)</li>
  <li>As an integrated part of the ADVISOR block-diagrams by setting the fuel_converter
    version to nn_ic (neural network internal combustion model).</li>
</ol>
<p>The first and second formats above are fairly self-explanatory and help is
available at the command prompt for users wishing to use these formats. One note
of caution: when using ADVISOR generated results to call the neural network
functions directly or through nnProc, users should use fc_spd_est*30/pi (fuel
converter [engine shaft] speed estimate in rad/s transformed to RPM) and
fc_brake_trq (the brake torque of the fuel_converter [engine shaft] in Nm). These
variables are used with ADVISOR's lookup table method and are the most
consistent.</p>
<p>The third format (within the ADVISOR block diagrams) for using the neural
network models will be where most users encounter the models and will be discussed briefly here.</p>
<p>Format 3 of the neural network models is available through a Simulink
S-function implemented as a configurable subsystem in the fuel_converter
drivetrain block (located in &lt;ADVISOR main directory&gt;/models/library/lib_fuel_converter.mdl).
At the input screen, the user should select nn_ic in the fuel_converter <a href="version_type_help.htm">version</a>
pull-down menu. In order to preserve all existing functionality in ADVISOR, a dummy engine map
is created at the input screen. The maximum torque curve from the initial engine
map is used to ensure
the vehicle stays within performance constraints. However, the user should note that the fuel usage map of
this dummy engine is not used. The neural network model
generates hot emissions data for CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, and NOx.</p>
<p> The neural network
model in format 3 is tied into ADVISOR's existing thermal model allowing
users to&nbsp;simulate the effects of engine warm-up and aftertreatment
scenarios. Users wishing to do such
studies should examine the initialization files fc_cummins_NN and fc_navistar_NN
to ensure proper assumptions have been made for thermal and emissions characteristics. As the
neural net only predicts NOx, CO, and CO2, maps can be defined for O2 content,
PM, and HC. Cold emissions maps can be defined as well. Fuel use is determined by the neural net through a carbon balance on the
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Fuel usage then allows for a determination of
efficiency and waste heat generation.&nbsp;</p>

are mentioned below:</p>
