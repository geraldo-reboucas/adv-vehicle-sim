<h1 align="left">Dedicated Auxiliary Load Models using Configurable Subsystems</h1>

<h2 align="left">Implementation</h2>
<p align="left">Advanced users of ADVISOR will notice two new blocks in the
ADVISOR vehicle powertrain block diagrams: Mechanical and Electrical Accessory
Loads. These blocks represent dedicated auxiliary load systems. The difference
between the two blocks is the source of energy. The mechanical accessory blocks
obtain their energy from a spinning shaft. Electrical loads require an
electrical source (e.g., power bus) to power their loads.</p>

        <br>(powered by electrical source)</td>

<p align="left">Each block contains a forward model and a backward model. In the
backward model, the auxiliary blocks modify torque or power requests going up-stream to include
that extra torque or power required to satisfy the accessory loads.
In the forward model, torque or power is subtracted from power generated
up-stream and sent to auxiliary loads. The remaining power flows downstream to
the powertrain.</p>
<p align="left">These powertrain blocks are contained in a dedicated accessory
loads library: lib_accessory (see &lt;ADVISOR main
directory&gt;\models\library). The lib_accessory library makes extensive use of
configurable sub-systems. Configurable sub-systems allow new models to be
switched into a simulink model &quot;on the fly&quot;. One such model allows the
simulation of speed-dependant mechanical accessory loads.</p>
<p align="left">To the casual user, these changes are transparent. The
configurable subsystems are switched using an m-file function called
adjust_config_bds.m (located in &lt;ADVISOR main directory&gt;\gui). The
adjust_config_bds.m file is called by the GUI after the user sets up the vehicle
definition. The adjust_config_bds.m file switches in the appropriate
configurable subsystem model based upon <a href="version_type_help.htm">version
and type</a>, and\or variables sent to the workspace.</p>
<h3 align="left"><a name="config_subsystemHOWTO">Adding your own configurable subsystems</a></h3>
<p align="left">It is now possible to add your own user models as configurable
subsystems in the library. The process is relatively straightforward for users
versed in Simulink. As an example, let us make a new
auxiliary load file in the accessory library (in lib_accessory.mdl). Start by
unlocking the library (edit&gt;unlock library). Next, copy and past an existing configurable
sub-system block. Break the links between the new block you are working on and
the old block (right click and link options&gt;disable link then link
options&gt; break link). Enter the block and keep the inputs and outputs the same but
change the &quot;guts&quot; of the model to implement your new system. Now,
click on the configurable subsystem template in the library. Place a check box
next to the new model you have just made. Viola! You now have a configurable
subsystem model.</p>
<p align="left">Next, edit adjust_config_bds.m to add the new configurable
subsystem choice to the appropriate portion of the switch-case menu. You may
need to create your own custom m-file that will load in the appropriate
initialization information for your new model. You can create a flag variable to
use for adjust_config_bds if you do not wish to create a new version/type.</p>
