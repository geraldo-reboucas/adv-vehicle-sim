<b>Energy Storage System</b></h3>
<b><u>Introduction</u></b>
<br>Of all the components in a hybrid vehicle, batteries are probably the
most difficult to understand and model.&nbsp; Although batteries seem to
act like simple electrical energy storage devices, when they deliver and
accept energy, they actually undergo thermally-dependent electrochemical
processes that make them difficult to model.&nbsp; Thus, the electrical
behavior of a battery is a nonlinear function of a variety of constantly
changing parameters. A dynamic model of electrochemical battery behavior
is a compromise between trying to include all of the relevant effects and
creating a model that will actually work in a reasonable amount of time.
<p>ADVISOR has four different battery models.
<ol>
<li>
The most recently developed model (Spring, 2001) is the <a href="ess_rc.htm">RC
model</a> ('resistive-capacitive'), which includes transient effects in
the battery.</li>

<li>
The previous model is the <a href="ess_rint.htm">Rint Model</a> ('internal
resistance'), which characterizes the battery with a voltage source and
internal resistance.The Rint battery model is related to work which was
originally performed by Idaho National Engineering Laboratory to model
flooded lead-acid batteries.&nbsp; ADVISOR uses this basic structure to
roughly simulate the behavior of a variety of battery technologies.</li>

<li>
The third battery model is a <a href="ess_alt_models.html#Fundamental">Fundamental
Lead Acid Model</a> developed at Brigham Young University for NREL.</li>

<li>
The fourth model is a <a href="ess_alt_models.html#Neural Network">neural
network model</a> of a lead acid battery developed at Colorado University
for NREL.</li>
</ol>

<p>Additionally, ADVISOR has one carbon-based ultracapacitor model.<p>A recent
addition (Spring, 2002) to the energy storage system library in ADVISOR is the
ultracapacitor (double layer capacitor, electrochemical capacitor).&nbsp;
Although the ultracapacitor is a device that is very similar to batteries in
many respects (electrodes, liquid electrolyte, and separator are main
components), it is also fundamentally different in how it accomplishes energy
storage/supply (double-layer capacitance and depending on the chemical make-up
of the ultracapacitor a varying extent of pseudo-capacitance).&nbsp; The
ultracapacitor model developed for ADVISOR is derived from the behavior of
carbon-based (double-layer) devices.&nbsp; The similarity between batteries and
ultracapacitors allows for a fair amount of overlap between modeling the two
devices.&nbsp; However, the main difference in modeling the two devices is that
the ultracapacitor actually behaves more ideally as a resistance + capacitance
based device.&nbsp; This allows for relatively close model behavior without
compromising actual device behavior.&nbsp; Additionally, due to the relatively
straightforward capacitance model, the ultracapacitor's state of charge is very
simple to determine.
<p>
The <a href="ess_uc.htm">UltraCap model</a> resides with the RC model drop down selections within
ADVISOR's gui in the &quot;energy storage&quot; block under version
&quot;rc&quot; and then under type &quot;cap&quot; (rc-&gt;cap).
