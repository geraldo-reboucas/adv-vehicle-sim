Emissions Standards--ADVISOR</h2></center>

Compliance with vehicle emissions standards is a critical step in the vehicle
development process.&nbsp; Given the availability of emissions maps for your
fuel converter, ADVISOR allows you to estimate the engine out and catalyst out
emissions.&nbsp; By comparing these values to published federal and state
standards it is possible to classify the vehicle in question and to understand
where to focus effort to improve the emissions classification of a
vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>The developers of the DieselNet website have done an outstanding job of
consolidating and summarizing both federal and state emissions standards. We
recommend that you visit their website for a summary of current
standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, please realize that the official standards are developed and
published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at the federal level and
the California Air Resources Board (CARB) at the California state level.&nbsp;
