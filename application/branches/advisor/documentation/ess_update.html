<b>Battery Model Updates Impacts, September, 1999</b></h3>
<b><u>Introduction</u></b>
<br>ADVISOR’s previous battery model was based on an equivalent circuit
model of the battery, with a voltage source and an internal resistance,
and an SOC measure based on a Peukert-derived capacity as a function of
average current.&nbsp; Through battery testing and validation performed
at NREL, it became apparent that there were limitations in the battery
model. To more closely represent battery behavior as experimentally observed,
the battery model has been updated. This new model is referred to as ‘New’
below, and the previous model as ‘Old.’
<p>The new model has four differences from the old model:
<ol>
<li>
SOC predictor based on amp-hours used in reference to a maximum capacity</li>

<li>
Minimum voltage of battery during discharge</li>

<li>
Maximum voltage of battery during charge</li>

<li>
Temperature effects of performance characteristics</li>
</ol>
The most significant updates are the new SOC algorithm and the temperature
modeling.&nbsp; On a straight discharge, the SOC update can have as much
as a 30% effect on SOC.&nbsp; During a cycle, the updated model tends to
increase performance (fuel economy) by as much as 12% for a series vehicle.&nbsp;
Temperature modeling had the effect of increasing performance (FE) by up
to 4%, depending on the battery technology.
<p><b><u>New to Old Model Comparison</u></b>
<br>The old model significantly under predicted the energy available from
a given battery. The <a href="glossary.htm#Peukert's Equation">Peukert</a>-limited
capacity was an artifact of the battery hitting the lower voltage limit
during discharge. In the laboratory, when the battery hit its lower voltage
limit for a high rate of discharge, there was still significant capacity
remaining in the battery. To extract this residual capacity, the current
request was simply dropped such that the lower voltage limit was not exceeded.
<p>Two representative constant-current discharges for two battery technologies
are presented below.&nbsp; In Figure 1, a lithium-ion battery was discharged
at a high rate (90A and 30A), allowed to rest for 10/15 minutes, then discharged
at a lower rate (1A and 3A).&nbsp; In Figure 2, a lead-acid battery was
discharged at a high rate (10A and 15A), allowed to rest for 30 minutes,
then discharged at a lower rate (1A).&nbsp; The new and old SOC models
were simulated using the experimental current profiles, and the graphs
compare the two results.

<br><b>Figure 2: Constant current discharge, Lead Acid battery with 30
minute rest</b></center>

<p>There are several important points to note about Figure 1 and Figure
2:
<ol>
<li>
The old model underpredicted SOC in all cases.&nbsp; The magnitude of this
under-prediction ranged from 2% when the battery fully 'recharged' to 30%
(25% shown here).</li>

<li>
The initial slope of SOC was more steep for the old model because the effective
capacity was not as large as the new model.</li>

<li>
If the old model reached 0% SOC during the first high-rate discharge, the
SOC was pinned to zero (right graph in Fig. 1 and left graph in Fig. 2).</li>

<li>
If the old model remained slightly above zero, the battery was seen to
'recharge' (left graph in Fig. 1 and right graph in Fig. 2).&nbsp; This
happened because during the resting period, the average current kept dropping,
thus raising the effective Peukert battery capacity.&nbsp; If allowed to
fully rest, the SOC eventually became constant as the battery's predicted
maximum capacity was reached (right graph in Fig. 2).&nbsp; The time period
for resting was dependent on the battery type.</li>
</ol>
A constant power discharge is another way to see the effects of the new
battery model.&nbsp; In Figures 3-6 below, a constant power of 100W was
requested of a 1Ah lead acid battery, and the results of both the new and
old battery models are presented.&nbsp; Figure 1 shows that for the first
280 seconds, the available power met the requested power.&nbsp; Figure
4 and Figure 5 show that during this time, the current and voltage varied.&nbsp;
The open circuit voltage dropped with SOC (see Figure 6), and the operating
voltage was a function of both the OCV and the discharge resistances (as
they also varied with SOC).&nbsp; The current adjusted to meet the power
request.

Power</b></center>

<p>For the old model, close to 280 seconds the SOC gets very low, the voltage
drops substantially, and the current spikes.&nbsp; Soon, the battery is
unable to meet the power request, and the available power is seen to exponentially
drop away (Fig. 3) until there is no energy left and the available power
is zero.&nbsp; During the power-decay section (~280-295 seconds), Figure
5 shows that the voltage stayed near 6 V.&nbsp; This was because the maximum
output power possible lay at half the open circuit voltage.

<br><b>Figure 4: Constant power discharge, Current</b></center>

<p>The new model incorporates a minimum battery voltage limit in addition
to a constant capacity equal to the maximum Ah capacity of the battery.&nbsp;
The onset of power-limited behavior seen with the new model occurs near
290 seconds.&nbsp; This is slightly later than the old model, because the
maximum capacity is greater than the avialable capacity predicted by the
Peukert model at this ~10C discharge rate.&nbsp; The current in Figure
4 for the new model does not spike, and Figure 5 shows that the voltage
was limited to the setpoint of 9.5 V.

<p>Figure 6 shows the final impact of the new battery model.&nbsp; The
new model shows that the battery had capacity to output power for 500 seconds,
while the old model stopped short of 300 seconds.&nbsp; Where the old model
stopped, the new model showed that there was 20% SOC remaining in the battery.
