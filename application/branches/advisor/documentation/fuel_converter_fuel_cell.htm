Fuel Converter for Fuel Cells</h3>
<i><a href="fc_fuel_cell.gif">Fuel Converter block diagram</a></i>
<p><b><u>Role of subsystem in vehicle</u></b>
<br>The fuel converter model simulates a power source for the vehicle.
In the case of a fuel cell based fuel converter, it is the electrochemical device that converts the fuel into
useable energy (electrical power) for the drivetrain. As modeled, it is
designed to be&nbsp; incorporated into a series vehicle configuration.
<p><b><u>Description of modeling approach</u></b>
<br>The fuel converter model in the fuel cell block diagram is a composite
of five different fuel cell models of which only one will be used during
any simulation.&nbsp; The user specifies which model is to be used through
the fc_fuel_cell_model flag variable.&nbsp; The five models available
include a power vs. efficiency model, a polarization curve model, an
external model called GCTool and two new fuel cell system models called the VT
and the KTH models. The two latter are described in (<a href="fuel_converter_fuel_cell_VT_model.htm">fuel_converter_fuel_cell_VT_model.htm</a>)
and (<a href="fuel_converter_fuel_cell_KTH_model.htm">fuel_converter_fuel_cell_KTH_model.htm</a>). Below
is the description of the power vs. efficiency model, the polarization curve model,
and the&nbsp; GCTool software.<p>Given a requested power calculated by the other submodels, the fuel
converter model determines the fuel cell operating point required to meet
these requirements while also accounting for accessory loads. Once the
achievable power has been determined, these values are passed back to the
rest of the vehicle model. These values are also used to determine the
fuel use and emissions for each time step. The fuel use and fuel converter
out emissions values are stored in tables indexed by fuel converter power.
Temperature correction factors have been incorporated to scale the fuel
use and emissions for cold starts.<p>The power vs. efficiency model requires
that the user provide the relationship between power out of the fuel cell
system and the fuel use and emissions out of the system.&nbsp; This model
is best applied when the user is not interested in specific operating characteristics
of the fuel cell.&nbsp; The polarization curve model requires that the
user provide more detailed information regarding the fuel cell system including
the voltage-current characteristics of the fuel cell and the power demand
characteristics of the fuel cell auxiliaries.&nbsp; The power out of the
system will then be the difference between the amount produced by the fuel
cell stack and that required by the auxiliaries. The fuel use and emissions
out will be dependent on the operating point of the fuel cell.&nbsp; Finally,
the GCTool-based model requires that the user have GCTool loaded on the
local machine.&nbsp;GCTool is a computation engine developed by Argonne
National Lab with specific routines for fuel cells.&nbsp; The model will
access GCTool as necessary to calculate the power out, fuel use, and emissions
values at each time step.
