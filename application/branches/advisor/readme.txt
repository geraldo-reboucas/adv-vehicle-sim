# Installation Instructions

1. Unzip the ADVISOR executable to the folder of your choice
2. Start MATLAB and change your current (active) directory 
   to be the top-level ADVISOR directory from step 1.
3. To run ADVISOR, type advisor at the MATLAB command prompt.

Note: ADVISOR now automatically adds the necessary paths beyond the 
top-level ADVISOR directory and gives the option of saving these paths 
so they do not need to be added the next time.
