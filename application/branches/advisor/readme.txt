Installation Instructions (for PCs) 

1) Run the executable file which will self-extract the ADVISOR matlab 
   files to a directory whose default name is ADVISOR2003
2) Start MATLAB 6.1 (or higher) and using the 'path browser', remove 
   any previous ADVISOR paths, then change your current (active) directory 
   to be the top-level ADVISOR directory.
3) To run ADVISOR, type advisor at the MATLAB command prompt.

Note: ADVISOR now automatically adds the necessary paths beyond the 
top-level ADVISOR directory and gives the option of saving these paths 
so they do not need to be added the next time. 

Optionally, you may also use an ADVISOR shortcut icon to launch ADVISOR and MATLAB
1) In the main ADVISOR directory, find the ADVISOR shortcut icon and copy it to your
   desktop.
2) Right click on the file and choose 'properties'.
3) Click on the shortcut tab.
4) Under 'Target' modify it to point to your MATLAB.EXE file (do a search 
   for MATLAB.EXE if necessary), followed by -r advisor.
5) Under 'Start in' enter in the main ADVISOR directory.
6) Hit the 'change icon' button, then hit browse and find the ADVISOR.bmp 
   file (not the shortcut file) in the main ADVISOR directory.
7) Then enter OK, and double-click on the icon to launch ADVISOR.

Direct any questions to advisor@nrel.gov.
