<b><font size=+1>Adaptive Control Strategy (previously named Real-Time
Control Strategy)</font></b></h3>
<b><u>Role of subsystem in vehicle</u></b>
<br>The Adaptive Control Strategy (ACS) for a parallel hybrid considers
both fuel economy and emissions in its choice of operating points.&nbsp;
ACS attempts to optimize at each time step the torque distribution between
the electric motor and the engine
<p><b><u>Description of modeling approach</u></b>
<br>Over the valid range of operating torques, ACS normalizes five competing
metrics (energy use, HC, CO, NOx, and PM emissions) by using user- and
standards-based weightings of time-averaged fuel economy and emissions
performance determine an overall impact function.&nbsp; The Adaptive Control
Strategy has the following characteristics:
<ul>
<li>
The instantaneous efficiencies of the engine, exhaust removal, motor, and
batteries are all included in the vehicle optimization.</li>

<li>
The ACS adjusts its behavior based on driving conditions:&nbsp; e.g. engine,
motor and battery temperatures and amount of available regenerative braking.&nbsp;
The amount of ‘free regenerative energy’ is calculated as the vehicle drives.</li>

<li>
There are user-definable fuel economy and emissions targets.</li>

<li>
For each operating point (e.g. a given speed), ACS looks at all the entire
range of possible motor-engine torque combinations to determine optimum
operation point.</li>

<li>
Performance is weighted sum of instantaneous mpg and g/mi by minimizing
Impact Function.</li>
</ul>
The ACS calculations follow the 6-step path described in the figure below.

<p><b><u>Variables used in subsystem</u></b>
<br>There are 13 variables that determine the operation of the Adaptive
Control Strategy.
