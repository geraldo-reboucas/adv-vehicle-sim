Clutch control</h3>
<i><a href="cltcntBD.gif">Clutch Control block diagram</a></i>
<p><b><u>Role of subsystem in vehicle</u></b>
<br>The clutch control determines whether the clutch should be fully engaged,
fully disengaged, or slipping--transmitting torque while the two sides
of the clutch spin at different speeds.
<p><b><u>Description of modeling approach</u></b>
<br>The state of the clutch depends on the requirements of the drivetrain.
<br>If either:
<ol>
<li>
The gear is changing, for an upshift or downshift, OR</li>

<li>
No (positive) torque is required of the engine AND (the driver disengages
the clutch during that situation OR the speed required of the engine is
less than its idle speed)</li>
</ol>
then the clutch is disengaged.
<br>If:
<ol>
<li>
Positive torque is required of the engine AND</li>

<li>
The speed required of the engine is less than the engine launch speed AND</li>

<li>
The clutch was not fully engaged at the previous time step</li>
</ol>
then the clutch is slipping (meaning that the engine is required to operate
at its launch speed).
<p>If the clutch is neither disengaged nor slipping, then it is engaged.
<p>If the clutch is being used in a parallel hybrid and the engine is off,
the clutch is disengaged regardless of the above conditions.
