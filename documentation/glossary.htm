<blockquote><b>Acceleration Test: </b>The acceleration test uses of an
input cycle of a step function of 200 mph.&nbsp; The simulation is run
with a 0.1 second time step rather than a 1 second default time step in
order to more accurately predict the vehicle response.&nbsp; If the vehicle
is a hybrid, the batteries begin at their high SOC limit.&nbsp; The gearbox
shift delay is set to 0.2 seconds.&nbsp; The test results are: 0-60 mph
time, 0-85 mph time, 40-60 time, maximum acceleration (ft/s<sup>2</sup>),
and distance (ft) travelled in 5 seconds.
<p><b>ADVISOR: </b>Acronym for ADvanced VehIcle SimulatOR.
<p><b>Auto-Size routine: </b>The auto-size routine takes the selected vehicle
and adjusts vehicle parameters until it meets acceleration and gradeability
goals.&nbsp; The parameters it alters are the fuel converter torque scale
(fc_trq_scale), the motor controller torque scale (mc_trq_scale), the number
of energy storage system modules--all of which affect the vehicle mass.&nbsp;
The minimum torque scale for the fuel converter is set so that its peak
power output is 40 kW.&nbsp; The number of battery modules is limited to
yield a maximum nominal voltage of 480 V.&nbsp; The minimum battery voltage
is determined by the voltage limits of the motor.&nbsp; The performance
targets are maintaining atleast a 6% grade at 55 mph, and obtaining less
than a 12 second 0-60 mph time, 23.4 second 0-85 mph time, and 5.3 second
40-60 mph time.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Capacity (of a battery):</b>&nbsp; The total amount of charge,
typically in Ampere-hours (Ah), that can be withdrawn from a fully charged
battery under specified conditions (from SAE J1715).&nbsp; Sometimes, this
value is referred to as C<sub>n</sub>, which is the capacity at a particular
discharge rate such that the battery is depleted in n hours. The available
capacity of a battery at a constant current is a function of the rate at
which it is discharged.&nbsp; This concept is explained in greater detail
in the ADVISOR glossary entry for state of charge (<a href="#SOC">SOC</a>).&nbsp;
The maximum capacity of the battery, evaluated at C<sub>5</sub> for example,
can be drawn from the battery, given that the current is reduced so as
to not drop below the minimum operating voltage.&nbsp; Whether a battery
can actually deliver the charge for which it is rated is also affected
by the temperature at which it is discharged and the history of how the
battery has been used over its lifetime. ADVISOR currently account for
these temperature effects, but does not model history effects.

<p><a NAME="Coulombic efficiency"></a><b>Coulombic efficiency</b>: When
a battery is depleted by discharge current, it will need more charge than
was taken out to fill it back up to its starting point. If you deplete
a full 20 Ah battery with the current at which it is rated, say 1A (which
would take 20 hours), and then you apply 1A to charge it back up, it will
take longer than 20 hours to fully restore the charge. For instance, it
might take 25 hours.&nbsp; Coulombic efficiency is defined as the total
charge removed divided by the total charge added to replenish the charge
removed. So, for our 20Ah battery example:
<center>
<p><img SRC="coulomb_effic.gif" height=45 width=285></center>

<p><a NAME="CNrate"></a><b>C/N rate</b>: The constant current which is
numerically the capacity divided by N.&nbsp; The result approximates the
N hour rate (from SAEJ1715).&nbsp; The C rate is a nominal current (amperes)
that is related to the capacity of the battery, where the capacity is defined
at a specified discharge rate. It is common for battery manufacturers to
come up with a rating for the <a href="#R">capacity</a> of a battery at
a relatively low discharge current.&nbsp; A battery would probably receive
a 20 Amp-hour rate if 1A of discharge current depleted a full battery in
20 hours.&nbsp; In this example, 1A would be the 20 hour rate, which is
the <a href="#N">N hour rate</a> commonly used by battery manufacturers
to determine a battery's official Amp-hour rating.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rating
refers to charge, or capacity (in Amp-Hours), whereas rate refers to a
current, or flow charge (in Amps, which is coulombs per second).
<p>For our 20Ah example above, other current rates would then typically
be defined as mathematical multiples of this basis rating. For instance,
a C/10 rate would be 2A, a C rate would be 20A, and a 5C rate would be
100A.&nbsp; Note that at the higher rates, the battery would have less
than the 20Ah rated capacity (see <a href="#Peukert's Equation">Peukert's
Equation</a>), so discharging at the C rate would actually take less than
one hour.

<p>Electrochemical and resistive components account for these voltage changes
under load, and they mostly represent energy that is lost to heat. The
magnitude of these losses is a function of many parameters such as the
temperature, the age of the battery, the magnitude and direction of current,
and the state of the battery.&nbsp; Also, these relationships are non-linear.&nbsp;

<p><a NAME="Peukert's Equation"></a><b>Peukert's Equation:&nbsp; </b>ADVISOR's
previous battery model used the Peukert equation to account for the observed
drop in constant-discharge-current capacity with increasing discharge rate.&nbsp;
In the new battery model, this capacity drop is maintained by imposing
a lower voltage limit on the battery operation, but the full battery capacity
is available.&nbsp; The Peukert equation below is therefore for reference
only and not used in the current battery model.
<p>In batteries, for higher discharge current, I, there is generally less
charge, Q, available; as the number of Amps goes up, usable Amp-Hours available
from a "full" battery goes down.&nbsp; Peukert's equation quantifies this
effect.
<p>The original form of the equation is:
<br><img SRC="peukert1.gif" height=21 width=67>

we divide both sides of Peukert's equation by <i>I<sup>n</sup></i>.
<br><img SRC="peukert2.gif" height=21 width=73>

of Charge (SOC) refers to a battery's residual charge capacity on a scale
from 0 to 1.&nbsp; 0 is empty, and 1 is full.&nbsp; Although SOC is not
directly measurable on an actual battery, for some battery technologies,
including Lead Acid and Lithium Ion, there is a correlation between the
SOC of a battery and the voltage that can be measured with a voltmeter
when the battery has been at rest long enough to reach equilibrium. When
current is drawn from the battery model during simulation, the battery’s
state of charge is depleted.&nbsp; Likewise, when charge current is injected
into the battery, the battery’s state of charge increases.&nbsp; In order
to account for energy that the battery has remaining, one must also consider
the voltage and time during which that charge is delivered.
<p>Note that the constant current charge that is available at full capacity
is not a fixed quantity. For a discussion of this phenomenon, see <a href="#Peukert's Equation">Peukert's
Equation</a>.
<p><b>SOC Linear Correct:</b> The Linear SOC correction routine runs two
simulations—one that gives a positive change in the state of charge and
one that gives a negative change in SOC. The initial SOC’s for the given
simulations are the low SOC limit (cs_lo_soc) and the high SOC limit (cs_hi_soc),
respectively. The corrected value of the variables of interest (e.g. miles
per gallon and emissions) are then interpolated from the zero change in
SOC from a linear fit to the two data points.

<p><b>SOC Zero Delta Correct:</b> The Zero-Delta SOC correction routine
adjusts the initial SOC until the simulation run yields a zero change in
SOC +/- a tolerance band. The routine will run for a maximum number of
iterations, and most simulations take approximately 5 runs to converge.&nbsp;
The default tolerance and maximum iterations are 0.5% and 15, respectively,
though these may be changed by the user in the simulation setup screen.&nbsp;
The algorithm is described in the following steps:
<ol>1. Initial SOC guess is the average of the high and low limits [the

is chosen so that the charge neutral point (zero <font face="Symbol">D</font>SOC)
is bracketed quickly.

<blockquote><b>Test Procedure--City/Highway: </b>This test runs both a
city (UDDS) and a highway (HWFET) cycle and appropriately combines the
result to obtain a combined fuel economy.&nbsp; The city values are based
on a cold start (initial catalyst and coolant temperatures are 20<sup>o</sup>C),
and the highway values are based on a hot start (initial catalyst temperature
= 500<sup>o</sup>C and initial coolant temperature = 95<sup>o</sup>C).&nbsp;
The combined miles per gallon is calculated as follows: <i>mpg_comb=1/(0.55/mpg_UDDS+0.45/mpg_HWFET)</i>.</blockquote>
