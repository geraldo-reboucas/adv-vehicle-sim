<h1>Sinda/Fluint Co-simulation</h1>
<ol><li><h2>Introduction</h2></li>

  <p>NREL's Vehicle Systems Analysis group is currently developing the ability
  to perform co-simulations between ADVISOR and Sinda/Fluint to provide in-depth
  transient modeling of air conditioning (A/C) systems. ADVISOR simulates the
  vehicle and drivetrain and provides the Sinda/Fluint A/C model with
  information such as compressor shaft speed and radiator intake air speed. The
  Sinda/Fluint model determines the loading on the engine shaft as well as a
  prediction of cabin cooling.</p>

<li><h2>Current Status</h2></li>

<p>The ability to perform a co-simulation between Sinda/Fluint and ADVISOR has been demonstrated at the lab (see
Reference 1 below). The s-function
to call Sinda/Fluint has been integrated into ADVISOR for the initial public release of ADVISOR version 2002. A Sinda/Fluint transient A/C model
is planned for inclusion in a future ADVISOR release.</p>

  <p>Users familiar with Sinda/Fluint who wish to integrate their own Sinda/Fluint models with ADVISOR can experiment with this functionality now by
  using the included auxiliary load block (lib_accessory/SindaTransAC) or
  creating their own auxiliary load block (similar to lib_accessory/SindaTransAC--see
  <a href="accessory_models2002.html">here</a> for details).</p>


<li><h2>Usage</h2></li>

<p>At the vehicle input screen, the user should select 'Sinda' for their
accessory model version. (The type is automatically 'Sinda' as well). A popup
menu will appear and ask if you have the proper setup to run a Sinda/Fluint
co-simulation. At the vary least you will require a properly licensed Sinda/Fluint
code. You will also need a Sinda/Fluint model to run in the form of a *.sin
function.</p></ol>
