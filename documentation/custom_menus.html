<h1>Customizing the ADVISOR Menus</h1>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
  </li>
  <p>
ADVISOR 2002 now supports the ability of user's to integrate their own custom
menus. User's can add or delete files from the pull-down menus of ADVISOR and
then save that master layout for usage later. As an example, a menu called
truck_menus has been included with ADVISOR 2002 to demonstrate the
functionality.
 <p><li>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
  </li>
  <p>
  At the main ADVISOR screen, users will notice a pull-down menu just above the start button.
  The choices available will be to use all_menus, truck_menus, or edit list. If
  'edit list' is chosen, the user can create, add, or delete new menu lists.

  By customizing lists, users can more easily separate files from different
  projects.
