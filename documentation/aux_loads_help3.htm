<P>The auxiliary load control figure is used to define the on/off profile relative to the drive cycle.&nbsp; Two definition options exist.  The on/off control can be defined by entering the times it will toggle on and off during the cycle.  If this method is used, the initial condition of the load can be input using the "Initially On" checkbox.  The other option is to define the load on/off in intervals.  This method requires entering the start time, period, and "duration on" time.  If the drive cycle is changed after the control is specified, the control definition method used will expand or shrink to fit the new drive cycle.  For example, say a 600-second SCO3 cycle was chosen.  Then the on/off control was defined with regular intervals.  The start time was set at 200 seconds, the period at 300 seconds, and the duration on at 50 seconds.  The on times would be from 200-250 and 500-550. If the cycle was then changed to a 1369 second UDDS, the on times would be between, 200-250, 500-550, 800-850, and 1100-1150 seconds. </P>
