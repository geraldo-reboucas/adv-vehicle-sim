<H3>Window Sticker</H3>
<P>The Window Sticker feature provides the EPA-like fuel economy ratings and annual fuel costs that a consumer would expect to see posted on the window of a new car.  The equations used to provide these results are as follows,</P>
<P>City = FTP-75 cycle fuel economy * 0.9</P>
<P>Highway = HWFET cycle fuel economy * 0.78</P>
<P>Annual fuel cost = (0.55/City+0.45/Highway) * annual mileage * fuel cost</P>
<P>The 0.9 and 0.78 correction factors are used by EPA to correlate the results from dynomometer testing to on-road operation while the 0.55 and 0.45 weighting factors are used by EPA to correctly account for the relative amounts of city and highway vehicle operation.  See the <A HREF="http://www.fueleconomy.gov/">Fuel Economy Guide</A> for more information.</P>
<P>Assumptions:</P>
<P>fuel cost = $1.65/gallon</P>
<P>annual mileage = 15000 miles/year</P>
