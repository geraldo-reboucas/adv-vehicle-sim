<h3>
Fuel Converter Scaling&nbsp;</h3>

<h4>
<u>Bore and Stroke Scaling</u></h4>
<p>This functionality is available by clicking on the button named fuel
converter in the input screen and selecting the button named &quot;Scale
Bore/Stroke&quot;.&nbsp; The procedure for this scaling is described in the
Final Report dated August 31, 2001 and named &quot;An Algorithm for Scaling
Engine Performance and Emissions with changes in Bore and Stroke&quot; by TECAT
Engineering Inc. under DOE Subcontract 4000003049 for Scott Sluder at Oak Ridge National
Laboratories. The fortran code provided with this report was converted over to
Matlab code and is now found under the main ADVISOR menu/extras/Scale_Bore_Stroke.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The files named interpolator and interpolator_data contain the main
algorithm.&nbsp;&nbsp;The screen capture below shows the fuel converter button,
that when pressed, opens a new figure containing the button for Bore/Stroke
scaling.</p>

<p>This scaling is limited to three types of engines for which WinKIVA and
TRANSIS simulations were run to obtain scalar tables.&nbsp; The user has to make
sure he/she is inputing the correct type of data to be able to obtain reasonable
results.&nbsp; Three types of engines are valid for this scaling and they
are:&nbsp; port injected gasoline engine, direct injection diesel engine and
direct injection stratified charge SI engine.&nbsp; The user has to select what
type of engine is to be scaled.&nbsp; For the port injected gasoline engine,
brake specific quantities are scaled and for the direct injected engines, the
indicated quantities are scaled (Since KIVA does not incorporate a friction
model).</p>
<p>The scaling algorithm first re-normalizes the simulated scalar tables by the
user selected baseline engine.&nbsp; The new baseline engine emissions scalars
are now unity while all other simulated emissions scalar tables at the various
bore and stroke values are now somewhat less than or greater than unity.&nbsp;
The new scalar tables are multiplied by the user-supplied baseline engine maps
to create new scaled engine maps.&nbsp; Below is the GUI for Bore and Stroke
Scaling.</p>
