Engine control (conventional vehicle)</h3>
<i><a href="engcntBD.gif">Engine Control Block Diagram</a></i>
<p><b><u>Role of subsystem in vehicle</u></b>
<br>The engine control determines whether the engine should be on or off
and at what speed the engine crankshaft should be turning.&nbsp; The command
signals it generates are used by the engine to determine fuel use, torque
delivered, and actual crankshaft speed.
<p><b><u>Description of modeling approach</u></b>
<br>There are two largely separate issues handled by the engine control:&nbsp;
engine state (on/off) and speed command.
<p>The engine is on if the key is on (<b>vc_key_on</b>) and the clutch
is not disengaged (meaning that torque is required) or if it is disengaged
and the engine idles rather than shutting down, as determined by <b>vc_idle_bool</b>.&nbsp;
It is shut off if the ignition key is off, as determined by <b>vc_key_on</b>.&nbsp;
And it will not shut down, even if the engine is commanded not to idle,
when transmission is shifting.
<p>The speed command is identical to the speed required at the clutch input
<i>unless</i>
the vehicle is about to launch:&nbsp; if the clutch is disengaged and the
vehicle is not moving and it must be moving one second in the future, the
engine will spin up to <b>vc_launch_spd</b>.&nbsp; Also, the engine will
spin at no less than <b>vc_idle_spd</b> if it is on.
