% REVISION HISTORY
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 07/01/98 (tm): file created from a_di65l.m 
% 07/03/98 (MC): changed fc_init_coolant_temp to fc_coolant_init_temp for
%                consistency with block diagrams
% 07/16/98 (SS): added variable fc_fuel_type under file id section
% 07/17/98 (tm): file renamed FC_CI119.M
% 08/28/98 (MC): added variable fc_disp under file id section
%                fc_ct_trq computed according to correlation from JDMA, 5/98
% 10/9/98 (vh,sb,ss): added pm and removed init conditions and added new exhaust variables
% 10/13/98 (MC): updated equation for fc_ct_trq (convert from ft-lb to Nm)
% 12/17/98 ss,sb: added 12 new variables for engine thermal modelling.
% 01/14/99 (SB): removed unneeded variables (fc_air_fuel_ratio, fc_ex_pwr_frac)
% 2/4/99: ss,sb changed fc_ext_sarea=0.3*(fc_max_pwr/100)^0.67  it was 0.3*(fc_max_pwr/100)
%		it now takes into account that surface area increases based on mass to the 2/3 power 
% 3/15/99:ss updated *_version to 2.1 from 2.0
% 7/9/99:tm cosmetic changes
% 11/03/99:ss updated version from 2.2 to 2.21
% 01/31/01: vhj added fc_cold=0, added cold map variables, added +eps to avoid dividing by zero
% 02/26/01: vhj added variable definition of fc_o2_map (used in NOx absorber emis.)
% 7/30/01:tm added user definable mass scaling function mass=f(fc_spd_scale,fc_trq_scale,fc_base_mass,fc_acc_mass,fc_fuel_mass)
